PY_CHAINOFDEBUG_TRANSLATION_INSTRUCTION="""
Below are C++ programs with incorrect Python translations. Explain the original code, then debug the translations block by block and correct them
using the provided feedback.
[c++]
unsigned int program_for_factorial_of_a_number ( unsigned int n ) {
    if ( n == 0 ) return 1;
    return n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number ( n - 1 );
}
[/c++]
[explanation]
The code is an implementation of calculating the factorial of a number.

if ( n == 0 ) return 1;
The function is defined recursively. When the given number is equal to 0, the result of the factorial is 1.

return n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number ( n - 1 );
Otherwise, the result of the factorial is the product of the given number and the (given number minus 1) factorial.
[/explanation]
[python]
def program_for_factorial_of_a_number(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        res = n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number((n - 1))
        return res
[/python]
The Python translation does not do the same thing as the C++ code. These are the results of one failed unit test that tests whether the Python translation's outputs match the C++ program's outputs:
Failed: assert program_for_factorial_of_a_number(0) == 1
Actual Result: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
Debug the program trace block by block until find the incorrect block. Every block should have different feedbacks:
[BLOCK-0]
    if n == 1:
    else:
        # n = 0
        res = n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number((n - 1))
[BLOCK-1]
    if n == 1:
    else:
        # n = -1
        res = n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number((n - 1))
[debug]
[BLOCK-0]
Feedback: INCORRECT. The original C++ code checks if n is equal to 0 in the base case, but the Python code is checking if n is equal to 1, which is incorrect. In the C++ code, the base case checks for n == 0.
[BLOCK-1]
Feedback: INCORRECT. There is a mistake in the recursive call. It should be n - 1 and be non-negative. We should also change the else to elif to better match the original C++ code.
[/debug]
Correct the translation.
[python]
def program_for_factorial_of_a_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n > 0:
        res = n * program_for_factorial_of_a_number(n - 1)
        return res

The Python translation does not do the same thing as the C++ code. These are the results of one failed unit test that tests whether the Python translation's outputs match the C++ program's outputs:

Debug the program trace block by block until find the incorrect block. Every block should have different feedbacks:

    # n=3   sum=0
[BLOCK-1]
    # n=3   sum=0

            # n=3   sum=0 i=0 j=0
[BLOCK-2]

            # n=3   sum=0 i=0 j=3

            # n=3   sum=0 i=1 j=0
            sum = (sum + (i * j))
            # n=3   sum=0 i=1 j=0
[debug]
[BLOCK-0]
Feedback: CORRECT. The function parameter `n` is 3. This block initializes the `sum` variable to 0.
[BLOCK-1]
Feedback: INCORRECT. The loops for i and j are correctly set up to match the C++ code. However, there is an issue in the loop range for i. The C++ code has i starting from 1 to n, but the Python code currently starts it from 0 to n-1. It should be corrected to match the C++ code's behavior.
[/debug]
Correct the translation.
[python]
def sum_pairwise_products(n):
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1, (n + 1)):
        for j in range(i, (n + 1)):
            sm = (sm + (i * j))
    return sm

PY_CHAINOFDEBUG_TEXT2CODE_INSTRUCTION="""# Write Python function to complete the task and pass the assertion tests.
### Task Start ###
# These are the assertions for your function:
assert find_char_long('Please move back to stream') == ['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream']

def find_char_long(text):
    \"\"\" Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string by using regex. \"\"\"
    if text == \"\":
        return []
    pat = r\"\\b\\w{4}\\b\"
    res = re.findall(pat, text)
    return res

Feedback: With the above function, the assertion is `find_char_long('Please move back to stream') == ['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream']` but the real execution output is `['move', 'back']`.
Debug the program trace block by block until find the incorrect block. Every block should have different feedbacks:
[BLOCK-1]
    # text=\"Please move back to stream\"
    if text == \"\":
[BLOCK-2]
    # text="Please move back to stream"
    pat = r\"\\b\\w{4}\\b\"
    res = re.findall(pat, text)
    # text=\"Please move back to stream\" pat=\"\\b\\w{4}\\b\"  res=['move', 'back']
[debug]
[BLOCK-1]
Feedback: CORRECT. This block is correct. It checks if the input text is empty. If the input text is empty, it returns an empty list without do regex match.
[BLOCK-2]
Feedback: INCORRECT. This block defines a regular expression pattern `pat` with value r\"\\b\\w{4}\\b\". However, there's an issue with the regular expression pattern. It only matches words that are exactly 4 characters long. Therefore, the return value `_ret` is `['move', 'back']`. In the task description, it asks for words *which are at least 4 characters long*. To fix the code, we should change the line `pat = r\"\\b\\w{4}\\b\"` into `pat = r\"\\b\\w{4,}\\b\"`.
[/debug]
Please fix the Python code.
[python]
import re
def find_char_long(text):
    \"\"\" Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string by using regex. \"\"\"
    if text == \"\":

    pat = r\"\\b\\w{4,}\\b\"
    res = re.findall(pat, text)
